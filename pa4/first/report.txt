In the program, the main data structure I used for simulating cache is called line. It contains three elements like a cache line. The structure is held by a 2D array. To realize the replacement policy of lru, it counts every time there is a hit and store the count in variable data. When it need to find the least recently used block, it can take the smallest one.

The prefetcher increases the cache hits and memory reads as it fetches data before it is needed.
